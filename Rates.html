rate</H3><P>An understanding of fishing effort is fundamental for
assessing and managing fish stocks. Most management principles involve deciding
directly or indirectly upon the amount of fishing effort (<I>f</I>) that should
be applied to the stock to obtain a certain amount of catch (<I>C</I>) that is
sustainable over time (Rothchild, 1977). Furthermore, the most commonly used
contemporary method of estimating the relative abundance of an exploited fish
stock is by using the catch per unit effort (<I>C/f</I>) as an index of
abundance.</P>
<P>The basic assumption in fisheries theory is that catch
(<I>C</I>) and stock abundance, or standing biomass (<I>B</I>) are related
by</P>

</TABLE>
<P>where <I>f</I> is a measurement of the nominal fishing effort
or intensity, and <I>q</I> is the so-called catchability coefficient (defined
below). The nominal fishing effort is expressed in for example the number of
fishermen, the number of boat-days, the number of meters of gillnet set, the
number of hooks set, the number of pulls or shots made, etc. For fisheries data,
however, it is generally difficult to measure the nominal effort precisely, and
in particular to standardize it in terms of relative fishing power.
Unfortunately, due to changes in the catchability coefficient <I>q</I>, there is
no necessarily fundamental relation between the magnitude of the nominal effort
and the magnitude of the catch. Therefore, for stock assessment purposes, there
is a need for a measure of fishing effort that has a constant effect upon the
fish population. This measure, commonly used in the population dynamics
literature, is the so-called fishing mortality.</P>
<P>The fishing mortality (<I>F</I>) is simply defined as the
fraction of the average population taken by fishing. In other words, <I>F</I>
can be considered as an invariant measure of effort (Rothchild, 1977). <I>F</I>
is also called the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality, i.e. the rate at
which fish are dying due to fishing, and therefore expressed per time unit,
usually per year. <I>F</I> can be measured without reference to the nominal
effort, the configuration of the fishing gear, or the manner in which the gear
is employed. <I>F</I> can be defined as</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Although <I>F</I> is defined as the fraction of the average
population abundance taken by fishing, and therefore one would expect it to take
values less than 1, it can in practice have a value of more than 1 on an annual
basis for stocks with a high biological regeneration rate. This is because the
annual <I>productivity</I> for such stocks, and therefore the cumulated annual
catches, can be much higher than the average standing abundance (mean biomass).
These are stocks - often smaller-sized tropical fish species - with a so-called
high biological turnover, or high production to biomass ratio (<I>P/B</I>).
These production concepts are further defined in Appendix 1.</P>
<P>The catch rate (<I>C/f</I>) or Catch per Unit of Effort
(<I>CpUE</I>) is the catch per unit of effort over a time interval and defined
as</P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>For scientific research surveys, or experimental fishing,
effort is standardized and fishing gears kept constant in order to keep a simple
relationship between catch rates and population abundance (<I>B</I>), i.e. to
minimize the inherent measurement errors and/or variations in <I>f</I> and
<I>q</I>. However, this so-called fishery-independent monitoring of stocks
through scientific surveys is expensive and surveys often cannot generate the
amount of data needed for the evaluation of states or changes in fish stocks or
mortality rates (fishing pattern), especially not in the highly diverse tropical
freshwater systems discussed in this report.</P>
<P>In many parts of the world, the main supply of information on
fishing effort, catch and catch rate is through monitoring of fisheries input
(fishing effort) and output (catch), i.e. through fishery-dependent monitoring.
Long-term monitoring of fish stocks therefore is almost by necessity dependent
on information obtained through the fisheries exploiting them and with that on
the official fisheries statistical system in use. Fishery-dependent monitoring
entails at least the collection of two essential parameters in fisheries
statistics: catch (<I>C</I>) and fishing effort (<I>f</I>) and from these the
derivation of catch rate (<I>C/f</I>) (FAO, 1999). CEDRS maintained to address
information needs for fishery management vary in their degree of administrative
and statistical sophistication, but all share the collection and maintenance of
these basic parameters.</P>
<H3><A NAME="bm03.1.2"></A> 2.1.2 Catchability</H3><P>Catchability (<I>q</I>) is defined (see equation 3) as the
relationship between the catch rate (<I>CpUE</I>) and the true population size
(<I>B</I>). So the unit of catchability is <I>fish caught per fish available per
effort unit and per time unit</I>. Catchability is also called gear efficiency
(Hilborn and Walters, 1992) or sometimes fishing power, and is strongly related
to gear selectivity (defined below) because it is species and size dependent.
Sometimes gear selection is simply defined as the relative change in <I>q</I>
(God&oslash;, 1990). Therefore the fishing mortality (<I>F</I>) as a function of
the size (length) of fish, i.e. the fraction of fish caught per fish in the
population, has the same shape as the gear selection curve (<I>S</I>), but with
a different value depending on the nominal effort.</P>
<P>In other words, when effort (<I>f</I>) is equal to 1 (unit)
then:</P>
<TABLE width="640" >
  <TR VALIGN="middle"> 
    <TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1> 
      <P><I>q = F = S</I></P></TD>
    <TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1> 
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">(4)</P></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>This means that <I>q</I> can conceptually be considered as the
probability of any single fish being caught. Therefore <I>q</I> ranges between 0
and 1.</P>
<P>However, the probability of a fish being caught at any time
depends on several factors, which are not only man-made, and can broadly be
grouped as biological or technological:</P>
<P>Biological factors include:</P>
<ul>
  <li>fish availability on the fishing ground</li>
  <li> fish behaviour towards the fishing gear</li>
  <li> the size, shape, and external features of the fish</li>
  <li> where some of these factors again are depending on season, age, environment 
    and other species.</li>
</ul>
<P>Technological factors include:</P>
<ul>
  <li>gear type, design, size, colour and material</li>
  <li> gear position, duration and handling</li>
  <li> experience of the fishermen</li>
  <li> where again these factors are depending on biological changes.</li>
</ul>
<P>As both the unit and the different notation show, the
catchability coefficient (alias efficiency, or fishing power, or probability of
a fish being caught), is therefore a composite and very complicated factor.
Conceptually, however, &#145;fish catchability&#146; implies primarily changes
in fish behaviour (May, 1984), whereas &#145;fishing efficiency&#146; indicates
changes in fishing practices (Neis <I>et al.,</I> 1999) or in relative fishing
power. As information on the possible causes of variation in <I>q</I> is
normally lacking, the biological and technological factors are for practical
purposes normally assumed invariant of abundance, time, species, size/age, and
the individual skills of the fishermen. However, only under this very rigid
assumption can the catch rate (<I>CpUE</I>) be considered directly proportional
to the stock abundance (Hilborn and Walters, 1992) and be used as an index of
the stock size.</P>
<P>Consequently, the catchability (<I>q</I>) cannot be quantified
directly if catch rates are used to estimate stock sizes. The standard solution
to evaluate changes in efficiency (fishing power) in a fishery over time, and
with that the catchability, is therefore to compare catch rates from commercial
and research fishing where the catchability of the research fishing is holding
constant from year to year (Neis <I>et al.,</I>1999):</P>
<TABLE width="640" >
  <TR VALIGN="middle">

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">(5)</P></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>This method requires several years of data in order to detect
relative changes in the efficiency of the commercial fishery. This lag in time,
before eventual changes are discovered, will lead to overestimation of stock
size if the commercial fishing efficiency or fishing power is rising (Pope,
1977).</P>
<P>The variability and elusiveness of the parameter <I>q</I>, and
the difficulties in quantifying it, is a very important reason for the
difficulties in analysing the relationship between the magnitude of nominal
effort (which is also difficult to measure) and the direct effect on the
regenerative capacity of the stocks. Changes in <I>q</I>, which are mostly
unaccounted for, induce additional uncertainty in the parameter catch rate as an
index of stock abundance, if <I>q</I> simply varies through time. If there is a
unidirectional change in <I>q</I>, as a result of, for instance, increased
fishing power of a unit of effort over time, catch rates - and with these stock
abundance - will be systematically overestimated. This is also an important
reason why, to a large extent, fisheries science is operating with the parameter
&#145;fishing mortality (<I>F</I>)&#146; instead of the parameter &#145;fishing
effort (<I>f</I>)&#146;. Unfortunately, fishing mortality is notorious for its
incomprehensibility outside the fisheries scientific community. However,
returning to equation (2), the elusiveness of <I>F</I>, and its relationship
with nominal effort and efficiency in a biological sense (i.e. the efficiency
with which a fish is caught) may become somewhat less obscure when illustrated
graphically (Figure 2.1).</P>
<H3><A NAME="bm03.1.3"></A> 2.1.3 Selectivity</H3><P>A generally important technical measure for fishing gears is
the size selectivity which is defined as the probability of fish being retained
in a fishing gear as a function of the length of the fish (Misund <I>et al.</I>,
2001). These probabilities are often expressed as various mathematical models. A
selection curve (i.e. the probability of capture plotted against the size of the
fish) for trawl gears is mostly sigmoid or S-shaped, whereas bell-shaped curves
are normally the case for gillnets and hooking gears. Important selectivity
measures are L<SUB>50</SUB> - defined as the length of the fish where the fish
have a 50% probability of being retained by the gear on encounter - and the
<I>selection factor</I> - defined as L<SUB>50</SUB> divided by mesh size in cm.
In addition to the <I>selection range</I> which is defined as L<SUB>75</SUB> -
L<SUB>25</SUB> (L<SUB>75</SUB> is the length of the fish where 75% of the fish
is retained, and L<SUB>25</SUB> is the length where 25% of the fish is
retained), these parameters describe the size selection characteristics of
fishing gears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B> Figure 2.1<I> Fishing
mortality (F) as a resultant of nominal fishing effort (f) and catchability (q).
The number of units expresses nominal fishing effort, while catchability can be
expressed by the efficiency of one unit of fishing effort</I></B></P>
<P>All fishing gears are species and size selective: this is also
true in multispecies fisheries where one type of gear may catch a set of
species, while another gear or the same gear used in a different way or
different area may catch another set. This means that all fishing gears are only
able to catch a certain portion of the total (multispecies) fish community
present. The use of the catch rate as an index of abundance of a fish stock is
therefore further complicated by the selectivity of a fishing gear. Catch rates
only reflect the abundance of the <I>fishable stock</I> or, in other words, that
portion of a fish population or fish community that can be caught by a specific
gear. Catch rates can be used as an index of abundance for the total stock,
under the assumption that all specimens within a (multispecies) stock at some
stage during their life become part of the fishable stock.</P>
<P>The area of operation of a gear, the inconstant behaviour of
the fish relative to the gear, and the size of the fish determine the part of a
stock that can be caught by a gear. As discussed, these factors are all included
in the parameter catchability. Selection may therefore differ in different areas
of operation simply because of the species and sizes present on a fishing
ground. For example, seines with small mesh sizes operated in shallow areas near
shore that act as nursery grounds will have a higher probability of catching
juvenile specimens than if they are operated further offshore where these fish
are not present. Species behaviour may change seasonally as a function of
several factors, such as migrations, spawning or temperature, and with this the
probability of catching it with a certain gear will also change. Furthermore,
species may develop avoidance behaviour towards gear, which will result in a
lower catchability. Some species are notorious for their ability to avoid
certain gear, for example the ubiquitous redbreast Tilapia is very difficult to
catch with gillnets.</P>
<P>Fishing gears are intrinsically associated with selectivity,
and selectivity, or the impact of fishing on an ecosystem, is an essential
component of a management programme. The importance of selectivity is therefore
a key point for most researchers and managers, and any non-selective capture
method automatically carries the connotation of being harmful or destructive, or
at least leading to growth-overfishing seen from the traditional single-species
perspective. Mesh size and gear restrictions are therefore among the most easily
applied and widely used management regulations. Consequently most nations have
imposed legislation that bans certain gears and mesh-sizes with the aim of
protecting the resource (Gulland, 1982). Although many of these regulations
originate from problems associated with the large scale-fisheries (Misund <I>et
al</I>., 2001), they are often uniformly applied in all sectors. However,
selectivity seems much more of a problem for industrialized fisheries that dump
on average about 45% of their catch, while small-scale artisanal discards
average only 5% (Bernacsek, 1989) despite the fact that they mostly operate in
more multispecies environments. Although numerous authors have already pointed
to the problems of defining the &#147;right&#148; mesh-size in a multispecies
fishery, the notion of regulations on selectivity still persists. In addition,
small-scale fisheries, such as those studied in this report, often use a variety
of gears, both traditional and modern. Many of these gears and particularly the
traditional ones, such as seines, small mesh-sizes, drive- or beat fishing,
barriers and weirs, are often classified as illegal under the pretext of being
non-selective with assumed negative impacts on the fish populations.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bm03.2"></A> 2.2 Social and economic
concepts</H2><H3><A NAME="bm03.2.1"></A> 2.2.1 Population- and
investment-driven changes in fishing effort and demographic change</H3><P>The preceding section is based on fisheries theory and
definitions. It is open to question, however, whether the concepts of
&#145;nominal fishing effort (<I>f</I>)&#146; and &#145;catchability
(<I>q</I>)&#146; - in particular where it deals with technological factors and
their biological impact on the fish stocks - can be readily applied within
social and economic treatments of fishing effort. In fisheries economics, for
example, fishing is analysed in terms of investments and revenue, and
&#145;effort&#146; is therefore conceptually associated with cost. According to
Hannesson (1993), it is generally impossible to develop any general valid
proportion between the nominal effort in terms of units and fishing effort in
the economic sense due to technological differences and/or changes and different
inputs of fuel, equipment, manpower, etc. Therefore in fisheries economics,
fishing effort (investment) is sometimes defined as the mortality generated on a
fish stock because that will more accurately predict the catch (or revenue).
This makes effort strictly equivalent with the fishing mortality (<I>F</I>) used
in population dynamics:</P>
<TABLE width="640" >
  <TR VALIGN="middle">

    <TD COLSPAN=1 ROWSPAN=1> 
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">(6)</P></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Comparing with equation (2), fisheries economics then appear
to have similar problems with the relationship between the nominal effort and
the catch as in fisheries biology with the elusive catchability coefficient
<I>q</I>.</P>
<P>As for fisheries economics, Brox (1990) does not distinguish
between nominal effort and fishing mortality. However, as a social scientist,
Brox is concerned with identifying how different ways of changing effort may
lead to very different social results. He therefore introduces the distinction
between <I>&#145;horizontal&#146;</I> and &#145;<I>vertical</I>&#146; changes in
fishing effort (or fishing mortality). Horizontal growth is related to the
growth in the number of fishermen: &#147;Fishermen&#146;s children grow up and
establish households that base their economy on participating in fisheries....
Fishing communities also absorb people born outside fishing districts,
especially through marriages, and young migrants initially looking for temporary
employment&#148;(Brox, 1990:233). It is important to note that horizontal growth
is different from demographic growth. While demographic growth in the
traditional meaning of the concept is understood as a function of birth- and
mortality rates, horizontal growth of effort also includes migration and changes
in people&#146;s occupations.</P>
<P>Vertical growth is related to growth in capital use and
technological level. &#147;The aggregate effort may also increase because each
operating unit acquires more technical equipment. This happens when some of the
formerly stagnant units begin to accumulate capital, but also as investors from
other branches of the economy, other regions or even other countries somehow
decide to participate in harvesting the resources.&#148; (Ibid.)</P>
<P>These concepts, which for the sake of clarity we have renamed
<I>population-driven </I>and <I>investment-driven </I>growth in fishing effort,
seem to come very close to the above distinction between nominal changes of
effort and changes in efficiency. From a biological point of view, however, it
is the interaction between the catching process (gear) and the fish that is
important. Thus, with regard to &#145;numerical growth of fishing effort&#146;,
it is the total number of units of gear and their employment that matters. Who
invests and at what level is irrelevant for the fishing mortality: 10 fishermen
owning 100 nets each is the same as 100 fishermen owning 10 nets each.
Investment-driven change in effort is therefore not directly equal to the
biological term &#145;catchability&#146;, but more related to
&#145;efficiency&#146;. The two concepts will only coincide if the unit of
fishing effort is understood to be production units and if the biological
variables (e.g. behaviour) included in catchability are excluded.</P>
<P>The importance of distinguishing between socio-economic
processes leading to simply numerical changes in nominal fishing effort or
increased efficiency from capital investments, lies in the different effect each
of these processes has on the sustainability of exploitation. The hypothesis is
that when investment-driven growth of effort accelerates, it represents a
potentially much bigger growth in absolute fishing mortality than that expected
to be caused by demographic processes. This expectation is based on the
presumption that investment-driven growth lead to technological changes towards
more effective gear, whereas population-driven growth, just leads to &#145;more
of the same&#146;. It is important not to consider population-driven changes in
effort as a mere reflection of the <I>demographic changes </I>in a community. As
mentioned above, demographic change is generally defined as the difference
between birth rates and death rates in a given population, but population-driven
change in fishing effort - as indicated by Brox - also includes changes due to
migration or to changes in occupations. As will be shown, these variables are
sometimes more important than the demographic changes.</P>
<H3><A NAME="bm03.2.2"></A> 2.2.2 Social
institutions</H3><P>Institutions constitute a central element in analysis of
effort development. In fisheries management literature, institutions are often
seen as government&#146;s way of organizing their fisheries administration. We
see institutions as much more than this. In recent years the
&#145;neo-institutionalist&#146; approaches in economy and political science
(e.g. Elinor Ostrom, Douglas North, Oliver Williamson and Jean-Philippe
Platteau) has dominated the understanding of social institutions. A commonly
used definition is: &#147;<I>Institutions are rights and rules that provide a
set of incentives and disincentives for individuals geared to minimize
transaction costs.&#148;</I></P>
<P>Several scholars have pointed out that the focus on
transaction costs and market imperfection is too narrow and neglects the
historical dimension in how rules have been constructed. From a sociological
perspective, Scott (1995) brings in the cognitive aspects and argues that
institutions are cultural, social structures and routines. From social
anthropology, Berry tends to view institutions &#147;...not as the rules
themselves, but as regularised patterns of behaviour that emerge from underlying
structures or sets of &#145;rules in use&#146;. ... Rather than existing as a
fixed framework, &#145;rules&#146; are constantly made and remade through
people&#146;s practices&#148; (Leach <I>et al.</I>, 1999: 237). The works of,
for instance, Berry (1989, 1993), Bierschenk and Olivier de Sardan (1998) and
Peters (2000), convincingly argue that local institutions crucial in the
regulation of people&#146;s access to vital resources are often unclear and even
lack coherence. Their research shows that so-called &#145;local management
systems&#146; have often emerged as a result of negotiation and accommodation in
long-term power struggles. Various actors, including a variety of external
powers operating at different periods of time, have based their claims and
legitimacy on different &#145;logics&#146; and values. The lack of hegemonic
power at the local level has facilitated their continued co-existence and has
entailed an institutional landscape where rules are characterized by ambiguity
and sometimes even by contradiction.</P>
<P>Our task here is not to support either the neo-institutional
or the more constructivist approach to institutional analysis, but simply to
point out the differences and alternatives that they represent in the analysis
of regulation and access to natural resources. In the same way that the
&#145;management&#146; and the co-management approaches represent alternative
ways for understanding existing management regimes, studies of African fisheries
have shown how both approaches have important contributions to provide
(Jul-Larsen, 1999). While the neo-institutional approach may shed light on the
fact that artisanal fisheries sometimes seem to out-compete more industrialized
fisheries, the constructivist approach may help us understand important
relationships between the local institutional landscape and prospects of
economic development.</P>
<P>We will also emphasize that institutions can be either formal
or informal and may be created or evolve over time. The nature of institutions
can be explained by the use of an iceberg analogy. The top, visible part of the
iceberg can be taken as the formal and written institutions, whereas the lower
part of the iceberg, which is not visible but exists, can be taken as the
informal and unwritten institutions. Both formal and informal codes may be
violated and therefore punishments are enacted. The essential part of the
functioning of institutions is thus determined by whether their codes can be
enforced, the cost of enforcement and the severity of the punishment.</P>
